Write a program that allows the user to navigate the elements present in the list given as:

List1 = [12,32,44,33,56,77,87,22,11,32]

The program should input the elements into a list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of elements in the list and prompts the user for a element. Actual list range from 1 to 10.

If the input is 0, it shows one message "program quits". Otherwise, the program prints the elements associated with that list.
